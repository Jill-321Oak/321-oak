## Simple Tomato Sauce Recipe

https://youtu.be/mcQH0LguRhc


### How to Make Tomato Juice, Sauce, or Paste

Yield: 1 gallon tomatoes = 1/2 gallon juice = 1 quart sauce = 6 oz. paste (approximate yields)

##### Ingredients:

- Tomatoes, washed and cored

##### Directions:

1. Blend: Place whole, cored, washed tomatoes into a blender or food processor. Blend to a smooth juice.
2. Strain: Use a cone-style strainer to strain out seeds and bits of skin.
3. Tomato Juice: For tomato juice, just bottle it up at this stage. See below for storage options.
4. Tomato Sauce: In a large, heavy-bottomed stockpot, BTB (bring to a boil), RTS (reduce to simmer), and simmer until the volume of juice is reduced by half. Let cool slightly and bottle in clean quart canning jars.
5. Tomato Paste: Continue simmering the sauce until it is reduced by half again, then transfer to one or more large, shallow baking dishes (such as a casserole dish). Bake at 270°F for many hours, stirring every hour at first, and more frequently as the paste begins to thicken. It’s done when it’s the same consistency as canned tomato paste.

### Processing and Storage

Store in the fridge for a couple of days, the freezer for a year, or can them, and they’ll last for decades. I’m at sea level, and I pressure can hot quarts of juice or sauce with 1/2 tsp of citric acid for 15 minutes (I'm at sea level, and canning at 10 psi. Canning times differ based on altitude and pressure, so look it up!). Anything that doesn’t seal goes in the fridge, where it will now last for a month, or the freezer. 

Key measures:
- Citric acid: 1/4 tsp for pints, 1/2 tsp for quarts
- Pressure canning, less than 1,000 ft at 10-11 lbs: 15 minutes ([source](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can/how-do-i-can-tomatoes/standard-tomato-sauce/))
