### Hello World, 

Welcome to 321 Oak. My name is Jill, and in this little corner of the web I'm going to start to write about life, learning, and the various skills, abilities and thoughts I've collected in 50 something years life.

I'm not exactly sure what it will become, and I imagine I'll update this page over time as I figure it out. I'm hoping to begin to document a collection of how to articles, general research on my hobbies and interests, and things that I've figured out over the years that might be useful to others.

As my content collection grows, I'll be starting a YouTube channel, and I'll also post on Instagram, Pinterest, and Facebook. Feel free to follow me around the internet if you're interested in how this turns out.

#### My Digital Garden
A quick note about this particular site. I use a note taking program called Obsidian that I love more than is reasonable. The combination of that program, and a plug in called Digital Garden are the core infrastructure I'm using. 

I've chosen this format because of the [[#Navigation Options]], the [[#Ad Free]], and the support for [[#Diverse but Interconnected]] growth.

##### Navigation Options
I really wanted a format that was very different than the usual blog. I want more structure than that enables. You will probably get to this site through some combination of internet search or links from my other media. Those links will take you directly to the article you're interested in. And if that's all you need, I hope you find the articles clear, concise, and simple to follow. 

You'll eventually see quite a lot of links to other articles - many of these will be internal to this site. To navigate around as if you were reading a book, please feel free to explore the file tree to the left. To follow the rabbit warren of my content, explore the graph view to the left, it will show articles that are liked to this one. As you navigate to different nodes, you'll find different articles appear in the graph. If you would rather deep dive into the specific topic of the article you're reading, please see the links at the bottom of this page. They show all articles that are directly connected to this one.

##### Ad Free
This site is, and I expect always will be, ad free. I personally hate getting to a recipe blog, for example, and having to navigate through a maze of ads - some of which pop up directly under my eyeballs. It's even worse when the ad itself is old or glitchy and crashes the page for a while. While I do hope to finance this project at some point, it will be through a combination of YouTube, partnerships, affiliate links, and product offerings - not through ads on the core site. 

This allows me the freedom to write as much or as little as the subject requires. I won't be trying to keep you captive by making you scroll past a dozen ads to get to what you really want to see. So, If you see a ridiculously long article here, you can be sure that it's because I'm trying to capture your interest and imagination for the purpose of entertainment and learning. I'm not trying to capture your eyeballs with the purpose of  racking up ad dollars.

##### Diverse but Interconnected
On this site, I'll be writing about the things I'm interested in, things I've figured out in my first 50ish years, and things I'd like my kids to know as they grow up. It's a rather ... diverse ... set of interests. The digital garden style works for that because if you've come here looking for recipes, you can skip all the unrelated stuff and just go to the recipes file on the left. If you have no interest in canning tomatoes, but want to know about how I plan a kayaking trip, you can similarly skip all the home and kitchen content and get right to the river where you belong. 

To start with, check out my first few posts: [[321 Oak/Kitchen, Cooking, and Recipes/From Picking to Powder - Processing Tomatoes\|From Picking to Powder - Processing Tomatoes]], [[321 Oak/Kitchen, Cooking, and Recipes/Recipe - Simple Tomato Sauce\|Recipe - Simple Tomato Sauce]]
