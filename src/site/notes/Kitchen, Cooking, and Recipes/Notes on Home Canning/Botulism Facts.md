## Just Facts and Sources

- C. *botulinum* can grow in low acid, sealed jars. ([source](https://extension.psu.edu/what-is-botulism/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/botulism/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) A by product of that growth is botulism toxin which is undetectable by sight, smell or taste. ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/prevention/home-canned-foods.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/HYG-5567-11?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) As a result, freshly opened low acid food jars may already have botulism toxin present. ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/prevention/home-canned-foods.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- High acid content inhibits C. *botulinum* growth, ([source](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/botulism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://extension.psu.edu/what-is-botulism/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/the-importance-of-food-ph-in-commercial-canning-operations.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) and therefore the production of botulism toxin.
- Boiling food for 5 minutes destroys botulism toxin. (Actually, it's destroyed by hating to 185 °F for 5 minutes, but without a thermometer, boiling is an easy mark.) ([source](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/botulism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/botulism.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://ucanr.edu/site/uc-master-food-preserver-program-orange-county/botulism?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Neither refrigeration nor freezing inactivates the toxin. ([source](https://www.nal.usda.gov/research-tools/food-safety-research-projects/stability-clostridium-botulinum-toxin-sample-extracts?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9008526/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Low acid canned food that faithfully follows a recommended recipe is more likely to have inactivated C. *botulinum* spores. ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/prevention/home-canned-foods.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can/general-information/ensuring-safe-canned-foods/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://extension.psu.edu/botulism-a-deadly-concern/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Reliably inactivating C. *botulinum* spores depends on time, temperature, the transfer of heat through the food (which depends on viscosity, particle size, packing style and liquid used), pH (even in low acid foods, small differences in pH can affect the process lethality), and water activity (affected by the formula of salt, sugar, fat, and starch). ([source](https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Biological_Engineering/Introduction_to_Biosystems_Engineering_%28Holden_et_al.%29/06%3A_Processing_Systems/6.02%3A_Principles_of_Thermal_Processing_of_Packaged_Foods?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://www.studocu.com/row/document/oyo-state-college-of-agriculture-and-technology/business-policy-and-strategy/list-and-explain-factors-that-affect-heat-penetration-of-cans-and-content/99079936?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://www.tiselab.com/pdf/Thermal-Processing-of-Food.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://www.fda.gov/files/food/published/Evaluation-and-Definition-of-Potentially-Hazardous-Foods.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) (source)
- Because of the specificity of these factors, even 'tested' recipes are said to be 'recommended processes' rather than 'safe' because the methods are rigorously tested to ensure safety when followed exactly, but no process can be guaranteed safe if the directions aren’t strictly observed. ([source](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can/general-information/equipment-and-methods-not-recommended/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can/general-information/for-safetys-sake/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://extension.missouri.edu/publications/gh1451?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://www.healthycanning.com/the-usdas-role-in-home-canning/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) 
- Water-bath canning is unsafe for low-acid foods because C. botulinum spores can survive hours of boiling at 212 °F. Even if a modest 1–2 log reduction is achieved, surviving spores can germinate in sealed jars, multiply, and produce toxin. ([source](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media_file/2021-02/Clostridium_botulinum.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780834219386)) ([source](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can/general-information/ensuring-safe-canned-foods/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Tales of differing regulations in European nations are untrue. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and national agencies recommend pressure canning for low-acid foods. ([source](https://acmsf.food.gov.uk/Risk%20Assessment)) ([source](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthlinkbc-files/home-canning-how-avoid-botulism)) ([source](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/botulism))
- Botulism toxin is a neurotoxin that is exceptionally toxic even at very small doses. In fact it is one of the most deadly substances known. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/botulism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/botulism?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Modern medicine can combat botulism with anti-toxin and ventilators (respiratory failure is common). Recuperation from botulism can be long and arduous. 5% of illnesses are fatal even in well equipped modern settings. ([source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8112830/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/213311-followup?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/botulism?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Foodborne Illness and death due to botulism is extremely rare. (Illness averages 20-30 cases per, with 0-3 deaths on average per year.) ([source](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.713101/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/php/national-botulism-surveillance/2021.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulism?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Most foodborne illness is not linked to home canning. Very, very few of these illnesses linked to home canning (6 per year average between 2001 and 2017). ([source](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.713101/full)) ([source](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.713101/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/php/national-botulism-surveillance/2021.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://extension.psu.edu/what-is-botulism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ([source](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can/general-information/ensuring-safe-canned-foods/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## But I do Have Opinions Too
So, these are the some of the facts about botulism that I was able to find many sources to support. For some opinion on the matter, please see [[Kitchen, Cooking, and Recipes/Notes on Home Canning/Risks of Home Canning\|Risks of Home Canning]].
