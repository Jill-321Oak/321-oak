### A Canning Timeline:

- in the early 1800s, Nicolas Appert invented the process of heat treating food in sealed glass jars. He publishes his method in 1810.
- 1858, John Landis Mason invented the Mason jar, with a threaded jars, rubber rings, and metal lids. The invention made canning practical in the home kitchen.
- in the early 1900s, between dozens and hundreds of botulism deaths per year were linked to home canning
- 1917, USDA begins recommending pressure canning for low acid foods. 
- 1920s and 30s, Research by Karl F. Meyer (UC Berkeley) and the USDA document the heat resistance of C. *botulinum* and the process needed to inactivate them. 
	- They find that C. *botulinum* spores can survive 5-6 hours of boiling in low acid foods
- In the early 2000s, 20-25% of us households were home canning. ([source](https://nchfp.uga.edu/papers/2007/canning_survey.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
