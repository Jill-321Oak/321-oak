### Canning Methods I Don't Use
#### Common "Old Time" Canning methods

In Pennsylvania, we have a lot of home preservers. Some because of Amish, Mennonite and related traditions, and some just because growing and putting up food is an Appalachian staple. So, I know people who have learned from long traditions of mothers and grandmothers. Sometimes they use methods that don't have modern scientific backing. Jut to be clear, I believe many or most of those in my community made the switch to pressure canning for low acid foods long ago. But there are still some using older traditional methods. I choose not to use these methods. 
###### These include: 
1. Open-Kettle: Hot food poured into sterilized jars with sterilized lids, but no further processing. 
2. Inverted Jars: Same as Open-Kettle, but the lids are turned upside down to cool.
3. Wax seals: using melted wax instead of a lid, especially on jams and jellies.
4. Oven Canning: Using oven heat to process instead of water.

#### Why don't I use them?

- I don't have the experience by myself or in a community that makes me confident that I know how to do it properly. If I had learned these techniques as a young girl in my grandmother's kitchen, I'm sure I'd be using some of them now. Also, I'm probably not clean enough for this. Cutting corners isn't a thing to do when all the pieces have to be sterilized.
- I have an electric canner, it it's way easier for me to to water bath or pressure can than any any of these. 
- Sterilizing jars sucks. I do not believe that putting something in a pot to boil (or a canner to boil) is less work than boiling the jars, handling them with the tongs, getting them full and wiped and sealed again while they're still piping hot. It's hot, tedious, messy work. Which then you have to clean up from. Give me a washed jar, food that's cool enough to handle easily, and I'll spend a few extra minutes to water bath or pressure can it. 
- Canning is too much effing work to risk spoiling. Seriously, I am all about minimizing effort, and there's a risk/rewards thing here. There are easier methods that have less risk of spoilage. I'm not talking about [[Kitchen, Cooking, and Recipes/Notes on Home Canning/Botulism Facts\|botulism]] here which is exceedingly rare, but very scary. I'm talking about other [[Kitchen, Cooking, and Recipes/Notes on Home Canning/Risks of Home Canning\|risks]] such as mold, yeast, and other pathogens that may gain entry (especially with the wax). I've never had a can spoil on me yet, and I want to keep it that way.
- And Oven Canning - no way. Too much risk of thermal shock, or breakage when I jostle them to put them in or out. Also - way harder on my back than just putting something in a pot at counter height.

#### Uncommon and Untraditional: 
There are others, that I'll classify as uncommon, but not unheard of. I don't know of any traditions where these have been commonly followed. Dishwasher, Sun, and Microwave canning seem to be much less common and not traditional, but mentioned occasionally. Why don't I use these? Whether you're [[Kitchen, Cooking, and Recipes/Notes on Home Canning/The Canning Wars\|BtB]] or [[Kitchen, Cooking, and Recipes/Notes on Home Canning/The Canning Wars\|Rebel]], I think we all agree that Safe canning is a function of controlling  time, temperature, and pH. None of these allow for that control.
