## Home Canning Carries With it the Risk of Spoilage

While there is a ton of discussion on the internet and elsewhere about canning safety, particularly when it comes to botulism, I don't think anyone would argue seriously with this premise. You can do it wrong. (You can can wrong?) Most of the time, if you do it wrong, you get perceptibly spoiled food. 

### Perceptible signs of spoilage:
There are a bunch of different things that both want to eat your food and will make you sick. (Besides your kids.) When we talk about risks in home canning though, we usually talk about [[Kitchen, Cooking, and Recipes/Notes on Home Canning/Botulism Facts\|botulism]], and we'll get to that. First though, the easier things. Most of the time if something is growing in your food, it's detectible. 

Bad jars may have visible mold or yeast. They may come unsealed because the growing things inside build up pressure. Or the food inside may look, feel, smell, or taste off. So, most foodborne pathogens can be detected, and illness prevented with a few rules. Perceptible signs include [[Kitchen, Cooking, and Recipes/Notes on Home Canning/Flat Sour\|Flat Sour]] which is spoiled because the food is unpleasant, not because it's toxic.

###### Don't eat it if: 
- it's not sealed
- you see something growing on it - like mold or yeast
- it smells bad
- it tastes bad

### Imperceptible spoilage:
There are two organisms which can cause foodborne illness and never be detected by these rules. They both belong to the same Genus - Clostridium. Specifically, they are C. *perfringens* and C. *botulinum*.

Neither of these is a danger with high acid food. Even if the spores are present, they will not germinate, the bacteria will not grow, and the food will not be spoiled. This is why the controversy is centered around low acid foods. 

#### C. *perfringens*
In order for C. *perfringens* to cause illness because of canned food, all of these things must be true: 
1. it must be in a low acid preparation and its spores must survive the canning process, 
2. it must have access to oxygen, so the jar needs to be opened
3. it must be allowed to multiply at temperatures in the 'danger zone' between 40 and 140 Fahrenheit
4. it must not be heated after it's been allowed to multiply. (Boiling for 10 minutes will kill it)

So, C. *perfringens* can absolutely make you sick, but you must make multiple mistakes for it to happen. In fact, in the US, you're more likely to get food poisoning from C. *perfringens* at an improperly maintained buffet than from canning. Also, while not mild, the illness isn't nearly as dangerous as botulism. C. *perfringens* will make you violently ill, possibly for days, and is dangerous to individuals with underlying health conditions.

#### C. *botulinum*
The related C. *botulinum* does not require so many errors. In order for C. *botulinum* to cause illness, all of these things must be true:
1. it must be in a low acid preparation and its spores must survive the canning process, 
2. it must not be heated before consuming it. (Boiling for 10 minutes will neutralize the toxin.)

The differences here are stark. Both of these bacteria are spore forming. They can basically detect a hostile environment and create armor against it to survive. They stay dormant in that spore state until the environment is right for them to grow and reproduce. The biggest issue is that C. *botulinum* grows anaerobically - without oxygen. So they will grow and reproduce in low acid food while it is stored - before it's opened. The toxin that makes you sick is a byproduct of the bacteria's growth. So if they've been growing, the toxin is present. And extraordinarily small amounts of it are needed to make you sick

Another difference is the severity of the illness. Botulism toxin is a neurotoxin that causes paralysis. It can be treated with modern medicine, including an antitoxin and ventilators, and because of that it is much less deadly now than it used to be. Historically, 50-60% of people infected died. With modern medicine, the range is 5-10%. 

##### How the Rebels are Right
Lastly, and here is where the controversy really heats up. It's exceedingly rare. So, those who claim that there's way too much hype and fear about [[Kitchen, Cooking, and Recipes/Notes on Home Canning/Botulism Facts\|botulism]] have the statistics on their side. In the US, there are an average of 0-3 deaths due to botulism from home canning per year. Yep. 0-3. Out of about 340 million people. So, it's literally less than a one in a million. 

So, you Rebels are 100% correct to point out the risks of getting botulism are really, really, really, (really), ridiculously small. 

##### How the BtBers are Right
Before the widespread use of pressure canning, the USDA regulations guiding people to pressure canning, and the discovery of the ability of C. *botulinum* to survive for hours at boiling temperatures, there were more cases of botulism in the US. It was still really small, but dozens of outbreaks a year were attributed to home canning in the us in the 1910s and 1920s.  Now we have about 3.5 times the population, so a return to that kind of prevalence of botulism would not be good. 

The toxicity of the thing is kind of crazy - a tiny bit will make you very very ill. And while you have a 95% chance of not dying with quick diagnosis and modern treatment, you still have a 5% chance of dying! That's crazy high. Also, even if you survive, you're likely to be very very ill for many months. So - granted the risk of getting it is vanishingly small. But the consequences of the illness are massive.

Last, and possibly most important, following the guidelines is easy. Yes you have to research recipes, volumes, canning times, etc. - but you're doing that anyway. Pressure canning takes less time, and with an electric canner, way less attention. 

##### My Opinion
It's just as easy to can according to the USDA guidelines, so I do it.
