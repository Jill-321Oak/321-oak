## Warmth Loving Bacillus

The members of Bacillus genus are the culprits that make "flat sour" an issue. They are spore forming, and some strains are exceptionally heat resistant and so can survive the canning process (yes, even pressure canning that will inactivate other spore forming bacteria). Some strains of the bacteria themselves can grow in anaerobic environments and they and they grow quickest when they are very warm. So, when you leave your jars in hot water for longer than recommended, you create an environment that's perfect for Bacillus to multiply. The flat sour taste is actually the bacteria's byproducts, not the bacteria themselves. 

So, if Bacillus can be even more heat tolerant than other spore formers, and they can grow in anerobic environments like [[Kitchen, Cooking, and Recipes/Notes on Home Canning/Botulism Facts\|C. botulinum]], why isn't it a huge issue? Well, it doesn't make you sick. Bacillus makes food unpleasant, but it won't make you sick. 

So why do some canners say they always leave their last batch in the water until the next morning, and they've never had jars go sour? 
- Because the jars didn't have the bacteria in them in the first place, 
- or because the spores were killed in the canning process (the can survive, but that doesn't mean they always do), 
- or because the food was too high in acid to allow the bacteria to flourish, 
- or because the bacterial load was too small to produce a noticeable change in flavor, 
- or (most likely) some combination of all of the above. 

### How to avoid Flat Sour
Goldilocks cooling! The trick here is not to cool your jars quickly - that can lead to siphoning and jar breakage. The trick is to cool them just right. That means aiming to get them out of the canner 10 - 15 minutes after the natural release of pressure. Aim to never leave jars in for more than 30 minutes.

Wait until the pressure naturally releases, crack the lid but leave it on the canner for about 5 minutes, take the lid off but leave your jars in for about 5 minutes. Then remove the jars. Cool your jars at room temperature, on a towel, with a couple of inches of space between them. Don't try to slow this by covering them with a towel, a sheet, or any other means. Don't try to rush it either. It's unnecessary, and risks jar breakage.
