## Processing Tomatoes

TL;DR: [[Kitchen, Cooking, and Recipes/Recipe - Simple Tomato Sauce\|Recipe - Simple Tomato Sauce]]

We use a ton of tomato products every year. Tomato juice, sauce, paste, pasta sauces, enchilada sauces, soups and stews, delicious beans, one way or another - we use some kind of tomato product every week. 

As I ease into my retirement - and my new life with a big lot in rural Pennsylvania - I'm learning put them up myself. We planted six plants this year, including a couple of little ones - cherries and grapes, a couple of Cherokee Purple, and an Amish Paste. I've been growing tomatoes for years, but this is our best harvest yet primarily because I have time to get out and pick them. 

While I'll process a lot of our own harvest, it's not nearly enough. I'll also buy some half bushel flats at the market, and we'll also continue to use store bought canned tomatoes as needed. Tomatoes are a great place to start your home canning journey. I do it because it's fun, and I like learning, and I like having home canned food.

### My Process
As I do, I've developed a process. I like it for several reasons: 
1) I almost never do it all in one day. My process has logical stopping points after each stage. Usually I'll pick one day, clean and sage the next, make juice the next, and can and make sauce in the same day. I don't have to though! I can wait a few days with the sauce in the fridge, or as long as i want with it in the freezer.
2) Most tomato processing methods include some combination of peeling and straining that is a ton of work. My choice of blending whole tomatoes and straining in my applesauce maker is the simplest I've seen.
3) Because it's all just pure tomatoes, I don't have to worry about ratios - there's no weighing or measuring things out. So I don't have to do any recipe math if I happen to have 0.69% of the weight or volume of tomatoes that the recipe calls for.
4) Because the end product is so simple, it's also incredibly versatile. I can use this in any kind of recipe from Italian pasta sauce to a Mexican red enchilada sauce to an Indian Curry. Someday, when I already have 52 quarts of simple tomato sauce on my shelf - then maybe I'll branch out. 

### Picking, Cleaning and Staging

1. Pick: When I pick, I'll get all the tomatoes that are ripe and any that look like they're halfway or more to the right color. 
2. Wash: I toss them in a sink full of cold water and a tiny bit of dish soap.
3. Gather: If I have a bucket of already picked and washed tomatoes that were staged for ripening, they get tossed in the sink too.
4. Sort: I rinse them, and set them to dry in four groups: slicing, ready to process, needs more time, and compost. 
	- Slicing: The best looking get set out on the counter for sandwiches, salads, and general household use. If there are any still her from last week, I move them into the ready to process group. 
	- Ready to process: ripe tomatoes, ready to be made into juice.
	- Needs more time: not ripe. These get dried, and then go in a bucket with a strainer in the bottom (for airflow). They'll get a retry next week.
	- Compost: there's always a few that get by my filter in the garden - so any that are soft, rotting, or otherwise not edible, they go in the compost.

### Juice and Sauce
#### First steps
1. Core: this is just taking the spot where the stem connected out. I don't go deep, and just use a little strawberry huller to do it.
2. Blend: I don't seed or peel - whole tomatoes go straight into the blender, and get whipped into juice.
3. Strain: I love my stand up apple sauce strainer for this. I got mine at a thrift store, but I'll try to find a link to one for you. This is an absolutely brilliant new part of my process, I used to strain in a more conventional strainer. It took forever and made a huge mess.

#### Tomato Juice
As soon as it's strained, it's tomato juice. I rarely leave it at this stage, but if you use a lot of juice instead of sauce, you certainly could! From here it will store in your fridge for a week or so, your freezer for a year or so, and if you can it it will store for a few decades or so.

Tomato juice can have a lot of water in it - if you leave it for a day or more, it will settle out, and you'll have a red layer on top and an amber kind of clear liquid at the bottom. It's totally fine and normal, just shake it up and it's right where it started.

#### Tomato Sauce
To move from juice to sauce, get a large heavy bottom sauce pan. Any pan will work, but a thin bottom pan may need more stirring. Add all your juice, note the level of liquid. With the lid on, bring the juice to a rolling boil, reduce to a fast simmer, and let it cook until the volume is reduced by half. So, if you have 6 quarts of juice, you'll keep boiling until you have 3 quarts left. Stir occasionally and scrape down the sides of the pan. 

As soon as it's reduced, you have sauce. You can store it any way you like. I can mine. I'm at sea level and I pressure can tomato juice for 30 minutes.

#### Tomato Paste
Something I'm interested in, but have not yet done is move it to the next stage, which is tomato paste. The recipes I have say to boil the sauce until it's reduced by half again, and the put it in a wide shallow baking dish (like a casserole dish), and dehydrate it in the oven at 270 for many hours. Stirring every hour at first, and more frequently as it gets thick.

While I think this process sounds interesting, I'm not sure it's super useful for a home cook. It's too thick to can, and my freezer space is too precious. Also, store bought tomato paste is just fine, pretty cheap, and doesn't take a week of my labor to produce. I'll probably try it just for the fun of it at some point - if only to get to the tomato powder option below.

#### Tomato Powder
Lots of people who skin their tomatoes dry the skin and turn it into powder, but I'm interested in trying to go from paste to powder. I have tomato powder for my home made backpacking meals, and it would be interesting to see if I could do it myself. 

This would mean taking tomato paste, spreading it thinly on silicon mats, dehydrating it for many more hours, and then breaking it up and grinding it to a smooth powder in a spice mill or food processor.

### Cooking with Tomatoes
I use tomato sauce and paste all the time. As I get more recipes added to this site, I'll begin to cross reference them all here. Just one quick note before I go. I purposely can just tomatoes - not pasta sauce, I don't add basil or sugar, or even salt. These will be used as an ingredient in a final dish, not by themselves.
