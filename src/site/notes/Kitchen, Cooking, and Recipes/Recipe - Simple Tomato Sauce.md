## The Simplest recipe for Tomato Sauce
![20250904_105534.jpg](/img/user/images/20250904_105534.jpg)
### Making Tomato Juice, Sauce, or Paste

Yield: 1 gallon tomatoes = 1/2 gallon juice = 1 quart sauce =  6 oz. paste
##### Ingredients: 
- tomatoes - washed and cored.
##### Directions:
1. Blend: Place whole cored washed tomatoes into a blender or food processor. Blend to a smooth juice.
2. Strain: Use a cone style strainer to strain out seeds and bits of skin.
3. Tomato Juice: for tomato juice, just bottle it up at this stage. See below for storage options.
4. Tomato Sauce: In a large heavy bottom stock pot, BTB (bring to boil), RTS (reduce to simmer), Simmer until the volume of juice is reduced by half. Let cool slightly and bottle in clean quart canning jars. 
5. Tomato Paste: continue simmering sauce until it is reduced by half again, transfer to one or more large shallow baking dishes (such as a casserole dish). Bake at 270 for many hours, stirring every hour at first, and more frequently as the paste begins to thicken. It's done when it's the same consistency as canned tomato paste.

### Processing and Storage

Store in the fridge for a couple of days, the freezer for a year, or can them and they'll last for decades. I am at sea level and I pressure can quarts of juice or sauce for 30 minutes. Anything that doesn't seal goes in the fridge - where it will now last for a month, or the freezer.
